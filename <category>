The <random> tag is used to respond to a user input in different ways. Each possible response
must be delimited by <li> tag. In this way, the chatterbot responses are handled as a list, and
the answers are randomly selected by the AIML interpreter.

The symbolic reduction technique is used for pattern simplification. Thus, a complex grammar
pattern is mapped into a set of simpler patterns. For instance, the question “WHO IS X”, where
X represents any entity, could be written in several ways, such as: “DO YOU KNOW WHO X
IS” and “TALK MORE ABOUT X”. The <srai> tag is used to map among these standards.
Table 3 presents the AIML code with an example of the usage of the symbolic reduction
technique.

The <that> tag tells the system to analyze the last sentence presented by the chatterbot. It is
noteworthy that to analyze the latest sequence of chatterbot is important when the bot has held a
question, and the user's response needs to be contextualized in relation to this question. This tag
must be within the <category> scope.

The content of <think> tag is processed by the chatterbot, but not displayed to user. This tag is
used for data processing, conditional statements and tests that should not be visible to user. In
Table 12, an AIML code example of this tag is displayed. In Line 4 the chatterbot stores the
user name in nameUser variable, without the user having knowledge of this assignment, once
the <set> command is in the <think> tag scope.
